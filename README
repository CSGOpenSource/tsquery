This is tsQuery, a lightweight JSONP interface to query OpenTSDB data (http://opentsdb.net/). It was originally based on the server component of tsDash (https://github.com/facebook/tsdash) but is being re-written to call OpenTSDB logic directly.

BUILD
=====

To build a deployable bundle run "ant war" from the root dir and this should create a .war file - tsquery.war - that can be deployed with any Servlet container (e.g. Apache Tomcat).

For convenience, IntelliJ IDEA 12 (http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) project files are included.
